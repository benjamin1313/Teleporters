# Teleporters

This plugin adds teleporters to your Minecraft server. You can link two teleporters together so that stepping on one of them will teleport you to the other. 

## Installation

*	[Install a Spigot server](https://github.com/DogOnFire/SeriousBusiness/#obtain-a-build-of-spigot)
*	Clone and compile
*	Drop the Teleporters.jar into the plugins folder.
*	Start your Spigot/CraftBukkit server. (Using /reload can have unwanted side effects with players still online, and with complex plugins dependencies, so it's not recommended.)
